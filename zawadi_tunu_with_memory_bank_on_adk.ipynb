Built as a demonstration of the Agent Development Kit (ADK) for Gemini and the Vertex AI Memory Bank, this agent's core strength lies in its ability to retain and recall nuanced information over time.\n",

              "   **1. Imaginative & Pretend Play:**\n",
              "   *   **Play Kitchen or Doctor's Kit:** Kids this age love to imitate adults. A play kitchen with food and utensils, or a doctor's kit, can provide hours of creative role-playing.\n",
              "   *   **Dress-Up Clothes:** A simple cape, a princess dress, an animal costume, or even just a fun hat can spark endless adventures.\n",
              "   *   **Dollhouse or Animal Figures:** Simple dollhouses with chunky furniture or sets of realistic (or fantastical) animal figures encourage storytelling and world-building.\n",
              "   *   **Puppets:** Hand puppets are great for putting on shows, developing language skills, and expressing emotions.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   **2. Creative & Artistic:**\n",
              "   *   **Washable Markers, Crayons & Large Paper:** Look for chunky crayons that are easy for small hands to grip. Washable is key!\n",

              "   *   **Wooden Blocks:** Simple, open-ended, and durable – classic wooden blocks are always a hit.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   **4. Outdoor & Active Play:**\n",
              "   *   **Tricycle or Balance Bike:** A tricycle is great for cruising, or a balance bike can help her learn to ride a two-wheeler faster down the line. (Don't forget a helmet!)\n",
              "   *   **Scooter:** A three-wheeled scooter is a fantastic way to develop balance and gross motor skills.\n",
              "   *   **Sand & Water Table:** Perfect for backyard fun, encouraging sensory play and imaginative scenarios.\n",
              "   *   **Bubble Machine:** Simple, inexpensive fun that always brings joy!\n",
              "   \n",
              "   **5. Educational & Learning:**\n",
              "   *   **Chunky Puzzles:** Look for puzzles with 10-20 pieces that have large, easy-to-grasp knobs or pieces.\n",
              "   *   **Sorting & Stacking Toys:** These help with color recognition, shape identification, and fine motor skills.\n",
              "   *   **Age-Appropriate Board Games:** Simple games like \"Hoot Owl Hoot!\" or \"Candy Land\" can teach turn-taking and basic rules.\n",
              "   *   **Interactive Books:** Books with lift-the-flaps, textures, or sound buttons are very engaging.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   **6. Books:**\n",
              "   *   **Picture Books:** Three-year-olds love engaging stories with colorful illustrations. Classics like \"The Very Hungry Caterpillar,\" \"Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?\", or newer popular series are great.\n",

              "       *   **What it is:** A two-wheeled bike without pedals or training wheels. Kids propel themselves by pushing off the ground with their feet.\n",
              "       *   **Why it's great for 3-year-olds:** This is often the *best* option for learning to ride a bike. It teaches children the most crucial skill first: **balance**. They learn to steer, lean into turns, and control their speed using their feet.\n",
              "       *   **Benefits:**\n",
              "           *   **Teaches Balance First:** This makes the transition to a pedal bike much easier and faster later on.\n",
              "           *   **Builds Confidence:** Kids feel in control because their feet are always on the ground.\n",
              "           *   **Develops Coordination:** Enhances gross motor skills and spatial awareness.\n",
              "           *   **Lightweight:** Easier for small children to handle and maneuver.\n",
              "       *   **What to look for:**\n",
              "           *   **Adjustable Seat Height:** Crucial so your niece can comfortably place her feet flat on the ground with a slight bend in her knees when sitting.\n",
              "           *   **Lightweight Frame:** Makes it easier for her to handle.\n",
              "           *   **Footrests:** Some have small platforms for kids to rest their feet once they're gliding.\n",
              "       *   **Example Brands:** Strider, Woom, Cruzee, Joovy.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   2.  **Tricycles**\n",
              "       *   **What it is:** A three-wheeled cycle with pedals.\n",
              "       *   **Why it's great for 3-year-olds:** Tricycles offer excellent stability, making them a good choice for kids who are just starting to understand the concept of pedaling.\n",

              "           *   **Easy to Get On/Off:** Low center of gravity.\n",
              "       *   **Considerations:**\n",
              "           *   **Doesn't Teach Balance:** Children will still need to learn balance separately if they transition to a two-wheeled pedal bike later.\n",
              "           *   **Can Be Outgrown Quickly:** Some children master pedaling quickly and then might get bored if they don't have the challenge of balancing.\n",
              "           *   **Turning Radius:** Can be wider than a balance bike, making tight turns harder.\n",
              "       *   **Variations:** Some tricycles come with a parent push-handle, which can be great for walks where she might get tired, allowing you to push her.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   3.  **Three-Wheeled Scooters (While not a bike, they're often considered for similar active play)**\n",
              "       *   **What it is:** A scooter with two wheels at the front and one at the back (or vice-versa) for added stability.\n",
              "       *   **Why it's great for 3-year-olds:** It's another fantastic way to develop balance, coordination, and gross motor skills in a fun and less intimidating way than a two-wheeled bike.\n",
              "       *   **Benefits:**\n",
              "           *   **Stability:** The three-wheel design provides excellent balance.\n",
              "           *   **Easy to Learn:** Kids can often pick up scooting very quickly.\n",
              "           *   **Develops Core Strength & Balance:** Through leaning to steer.\n",
              "           *   **Fun & Active:** Great for outdoor energy release.\n",
              "       *   **What to look for:**\n",

              "           *   **Lean-to-Steer Mechanism:** This is often easier for young children than handlebar steering.\n",
              "           *   **Durable Wheels:** For a smooth ride.\n",
              "       *   **Example Brands:** Micro Kickboard Mini Deluxe, Globber.\n",
              "   \n",

              "   \n",
              "   *   **Pedal Bikes with Training Wheels:** While many kids start with these, they are generally **less recommended for 3-year-olds** for several reasons:\n",
              "       *   **Weight:** They are often quite heavy for a small child.\n",
              "       *   **Teaches Incorrect Balance:** Training wheels actually prevent children from learning true balance because they lean *away* from the training wheel when turning, which is the opposite of how you balance on a two-wheeled bike.\n",

            "3.  **Toddler-Sized Dolls (larger than baby dolls, smaller than American Girl):** These dolls are designed to look like slightly older children. They often have soft, brushable hair (but not too fine that it tangles instantly) and simple, removable clothing that's easy for little hands to manage, which helps with fine motor skills.\n",
            "    *   **Why they're good:** Encourage dressing and undressing, imaginative scenarios, and can become a loyal companion.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Dolls with Diverse Appearances:** Consider a doll that reflects different skin tones, hair textures, or even those that come with hearing aids or glasses. This promotes inclusivity and helps children see themselves and others represented in their play.\n",

These encourage creativity and fine motor skills.\\n2.  **Imaginative Play:**\\n    *   **Dress-up Clothes:** A princess gown, a superhero cape, or animal costumes can spark hours of imaginative play.\\n    *   **Play Kitchen Set:** A small play kitchen with toy food and utensils can be a big hit for role-playing.\\n    *   **Dollhouse or Animal Figures:** Simple, durable sets that encourage storytelling.\\n3.  **Building Toys:** Large building blocks like LEGO Duplo or magnetic tiles are excellent for developing spatial reasoning and creativity.\\n4.  **Picture Books:** A collection of engaging and colorful picture books. You could look for interactive books with flaps or textures.\\n5.  **Age-Appropriate Puzzles or Games:** Simple wooden puzzles (12-24 pieces) or beginner board games like \\\"Candyland\\\" or \\\"Chutes and Ladders\\\" are great for developing problem-solving skills and teaching turn-taking.\"}],\"role\":\"model\"}\n",

Dolls are fantastic for fostering nurturing play, imagination, and social-emotional development in three-year-olds.\\n\\nHere are some types of dolls that are generally great for her age:\\n\\n1.  **Soft-Bodied Baby Dolls:** These are often a huge hit. They're perfect for cuddling, rocking, and mimicking parental care. Look for ones with soft bodies and gentle, un-stylable hair (or molded hair) that won't tangle easily. Many come with simple accessories like a bottle or a blanket.\\n    *   **Why they're good:** Encourage empathy, role-playing, and are easy for small hands to hold and hug.\\n\\n2.  **Rag Dolls:** Classic and timeless, rag dolls are typically very soft, safe (no hard parts to worry about), and often have friendly, embroidered faces. They're durable and can withstand a lot of love and play.\\n    *   **Why they're good:** Extremely huggable, safe, and often machine washable.\\n\\n3.  **Toddler-Sized Dolls (larger than baby dolls, smaller than American Girl):** These dolls are designed to look like slightly older children. They often have soft, brushable hair (but not too fine that it tangles instantly) and simple, removable clothing that's easy for little hands to manage, which helps with fine motor skills.\\n    *   **Why they're good:** Encourage dressing and undressing, imaginative scenarios, and can become a loyal companion.\\n\\n4.  **Dolls with Diverse Appearances:** Consider a doll that reflects different skin tones, hair textures, or even those that come with hearing aids or glasses. This promotes inclusivity and helps children see themselves and others represented in their play.\\n    *   **Why they're good:** Fosters understanding and acceptance of diversity from a young age.\\n\\n**Things to keep in mind when choosing:**\\n\\n*   **Size:** Not too small that parts could be a choking hazard (though for a 3-year-old, most standard play dolls are fine), and not too large that she can't easily carry and manipulate it.\\n*   **Durability:** Three-year-olds can be tough on toys, so look for well-made dolls that can withstand being dropped, hugged tightly, and perhaps even cleaned.\\n*   **Washability:** Life with a three-year-old often involves spills. A doll that can be wiped clean or even machine washed (check the label!) is a big plus.\\n*   **Simple Features:** At this age, less is often more. Dolls with basic, sweet faces allow children to project their own emotions and stories onto them, rather than being limited by complex expressions or functions. Avoid dolls with many tiny, removable accessories that could get lost or pose a choking risk.\\n\\nA soft, huggable baby doll or a charming rag doll would likely be an absolute winner!\"}],\"role\":\"model\"}\n",

        "* **Explicit remember / forget instructions (`EXPLICIT_INSTRUCTIONS`)**: Information that the user explicitly asks the agent to remember or forget. For example, if the user says \"Remember that I primarily use Python,\" Memory Bank generates a memory such as \"I primarily use Python.\"\n",
